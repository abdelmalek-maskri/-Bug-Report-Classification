# Bug Report Classification using Naive Bayes & TF-IDF

This repository contains my **Tool Building Project** for the **Intelligent Software Engineering (ISE) coursework**.  
I have chosen **Option 1: Tool Building Project**, and the problem I am addressing is **Bug Report Classification (Lab 1)**.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to **build an intelligent tool** that classifies bug reports as either:
- **Performance bug-related** (e.g., accuracy/inference speed issues).
- **Non-performance bug-related** (other issues).

### **Approach**
- I use **TF-IDF** to convert bug report text into numerical features.
- A **Naive Bayes classifier** is trained to predict whether a bug report is performance-related or not.
- The classifier is evaluated using **precision, recall, and F1-score**.

## 🔧 Implemented Features
✔️ **Preprocessing of bug report text**  
✔️ **Feature extraction using TF-IDF**  
✔️ **Naive Bayes classifier for binary classification**  
✔️ **Evaluation with precision, recall, and F1-score**  
✔️ **Statistical analysis for performance comparison**
